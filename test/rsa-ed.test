# Scenario:
# Mixed tinc-version nodes on network, node bar gets upgrade to >= 1.1
# 
# foo connects to node bar version >= 1.1
# ed25519 exchange starts
# bar drops connection from foo: Peer foo (::1 port 48413) tries to roll back protocol version to 17.1
# work around is to remove Ed25519PublicKey from foo on bar
